# Coding to Learn and Create - Inclusive Coding Environment

The Inclusive Coding Environment is a new educational coding tool designed for learners with disabilities. The
Environment can be used with a mouse, touchscreen, or keyboard, and supports assistive technologies such as screen
readers. It is a web application that works in the Chrome browser.

## Installation for Developers

Running this project requires [npm and Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Many of the scripts used in this package
require npx, which is included with npm 5.2.0 or higher. Once you download or fork the source code, you will need to
install the required dependencies using a command like:

```shell
npm install
```

## Start the application

To start the app in development mode, use a command like:

```shell
npm start
```

A URL like [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will be displayed in the console output, open that URL with
a browser to see the Coding Environment in action. The browser window will reload if you add or change files. You
will also see any lint errors in the console (see [our Contributor's guide for details](./docs/contributing.md)).

## Testing

To run the tests in this package, use a command like:

```shell
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. We are using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and
[Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) testing frameworks. For more details, see [our Contributor's guide](./docs/contributing.md).
