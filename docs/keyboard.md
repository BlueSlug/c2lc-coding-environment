# Key Bindings

A keyboard shortcut provides fast access to a range of Weavly's features using
one or more key presses.  Keyboard shortcuts are disabled by default, and can be
turned on using the keyboard input menu, which is displayed when the keyboard
icon is clicked.  Once key bindings are enabled, the keyboard input menu can
also be opened using the question mark key.

Weavly supports two sets of keyboard shortcuts.  The most basic shortcuts are
activated by holding a key like alt, or holding control and alt at the same
time, and then pressing a particular letter.  Longer shortcuts involve hitting a
combination of keys to start a sequence, and then entering additional letters.

In the instructions below, keys that need to be held at the same time are
indicated using plus signs, and keys that need to be entered separately are
divided using commas. For example, the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + x, x` is
activated by holding control, alt, and x at the same time, releasing all keys,
and then hitting the x key again by itself.

## Control+Alt (Apple: Control+Option) Key Bindings

NVDA has many commands that make use of the alt key, to avoid
        conflicting with these, the default keyboard input scheme uses the control
        and alt keys in combination with the starting key of a sequence.
        Those key bindings are as follows.
