# Architectural Decision Records

For non-trivial architecture changes, our team uses Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to propose, discuss, and agree
on how/whether to update our architecture.  For more information on what an ADR is, check out:

1. [Michael Nygard's blog post on the topic.](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
2. [The ADR GitHub organisation](https://adr.github.io)

We use [this template based on Nygard's blog post](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md)
as the starting point for our ADRs.

ADRs should be submitted as pull requests against this repository, which add a new ADR to this directory.  ADRs are
named based on the order in which they are approved.  For example, the first ADR approved is named `ADR001.md`, the
second is `ADR002.md`.  If more than one ADR is under review at a given time, the second to be approved should be
renamed to use the next ADR number.
