# About These Files

These sounds were recorded for this project, see the LICENSE.txt file for terms of use.  The patch used is from the Arturia V Collection, and is a CS-80 patch called "Kitten Run"".

Each filename corresponds to the pitch of the note.  The individual sounds are meant to be sped up and slowed down to simulate a fuller range of pitches.
