# About These Files

These sounds were recorded for this project, see the LICENSE.txt file for terms of use.  The patch used is from the Arturia V Collection, and is a CS-80 patch called "Kitten Run".

Each filename corresponds to the pitch of the note.  The individual sounds are meant to be sped up and slowed down to simulate a fuller range of pitches.

The patch has a built in arpeggiation.  For the slowest speed (1), a single
arpeggiation is played, and slowly.  For the next speed (2), two arpeggiations
are played, twice as fast as (1).  For the highest speed (3), three arpeggiaions
are played, three times as fast as (1).
